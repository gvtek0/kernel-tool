# Kernel Version from Image

If for some reason you want to find the version of a keknel image file. For example, i was curious after compiling during a Gentoo install.

Usage:

File is just the code, please run before executing:

> gcc -o kver kver.c

Then run:

> ./kver [path to Kernel image file]

Admittedly stolena bit ago from a Stackoverflow answer, will link for credit if I can find it again. Just thought this would be useful to have in the arsenal.
